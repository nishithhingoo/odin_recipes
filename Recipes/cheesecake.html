    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.[1] Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked (and is usually refrigerated).
        </p>
        <p>
            Cheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored in different ways. Vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or other flavors may be added to the main cheese layer. Additional flavors and visual appeal may be added by topping the finished dessert with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, or other ingredients.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup blanched slivered almonds</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 10 inch round cake pan.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light. Stir in the flour and mix until the mixture is mealy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Combine the baking powder and milk, add to the egg mixture, mix well. Then combine the lemon juice and baking soda, stir into the batter. Pour into the prepared cake pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove and sprinkle the nuts and sugar over the cake, then return it to the oven for 20 to 30 additional minutes, until cake springs back to the touch. Gently cut a small hole in the cake and place a quarter in the hole. Try to cover the hole with sugar. Cool cake on a rack for 10 minutes before inverting onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Serve cake warm. Each person in the family gets a slice starting with the youngest. The person who gets the quarter in their piece, gets good luck for the whole year!
